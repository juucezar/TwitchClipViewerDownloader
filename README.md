# TwitchClipViewerDownloader
I'm developing this application that consume Twitch's API to show and download clips and vods

Initially I'm using this as an way to study and apply new tecnies that I found, eventually I'll make it more and more complex.

For you to use this prject you will need to get an client-id and client-secret.
